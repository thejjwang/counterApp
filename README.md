Project Title: Counter App
Project Description: Create a counter app that displays a number and allows users to increment or decrement the number.
Project Requirements:
The app should be built using React.
The app should use the useState hook to store the current value of the counter.
The app should have two buttons: one to increment the counter and one to decrement the counter.
Project Goals:
To practice your understanding of props, components, and useState.
To learn how to use the useState hook to store state in a React app.
Here are some additional ideas for features that you could add to your counter app:

The ability to reset the counter to 0.
